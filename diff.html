           Creating curriculum and content for courses that are developmentally appropriate presents a challenge in most formal education settings, especially when students are marched through a lock step system of promotion by grade that falls heavily on the child's age, rather than considering their readiness based on developmental milestones i the student or child themselves.<br />
          As this is a personal project for consideration for my own Master's program, I wanted to build out my version the computer science sequence that allows students to move at a pace that is appropriate for the 9th grader who's been going to 'tech' camps since third grade, has a strong skillset in mathematics, and has learned to develop skills of independence, curiosity and self efficacy.  In the same class, a student in the 11th grade is struggling with foundational concepts of variables, loops and conditionals.<br />
              Due to the small school size, and a lack of graduation requirement in Computer Science & Technology, students take the courses for a number of reasons, from pure interest and passion to an elective that 'fits' and perhaps, because it's an elective an easy course with less work (because it's an elective).  This leads to an ENORMOUS range of abilities, knowledge and skills gaps, and can be frustrating for students at both end of the spectrum.  Our LMS is not fancy, and does not provide for much content storage, self paced modules, or grading that considers differentiation.
              So, my approach was to take a pre-existing curriculum, CS50x, specifically CS50 AP designed to meet the core requirements of the AP College Board requirements for AP Computer Science.  Again, as we are a small school, this course was intended to be a home for students of a range of abilities and backgrounds.  However, managing individual materials and curriculum for each student in the course, was far too much, and so - I have adapted CS50AP from Harvard's CS50 platform.  A core focus of this project was creating materials and assignments that would provide a range of activities, that include a core set, but also remedial labs that provide review or remediation if there are problems, and 'hacker' editions of problems, like the two versions of Mario or lemonade stand.<br />
    Though still in progress, the first hurdle of this project was writing code to permit custom tests to run in the GitHub codespaces environment - that could still piggy back the CS50 libraries in the C and Python languages.
