    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>This course&#8217;s philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable." 
		The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course&#8217;s material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on problems is not permitted (unless explicitly stated otherwise) except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code or writing to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy&#8217;s other constraints. Collaboration on quizzes and tests is not permitted at all. Collaboration on the final project is permitted to the extent prescribed by its specification.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Below are rules of thumb that should guide you about reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it until you ask and receive approval in writing from your instructor. If a violation of this policy is suspected and confirmed, your instructor reserves the right to impose local sanctions on top of any disciplinary outcome that may include an unsatisfactory or failing grade for work submitted or for the course itself.</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Recall that CS50 uses (cs50.dev) a web-based IDE "integrated development environment" that allows you to program "in the cloud," without installing any software locally. Underneath the hood is a popular operating system, Ubuntu Linux, that’s been "containerized" with open-source software called Docker, that allows multiple users (like you!) to share the operating system’s "kernel" (its nucleus, so to speak) and files, even while having files of their own. Indeed, CS50 IDE provides you with your very own "workspace" (i.e., storage space) in which you can save your own files and folders (aka directories).  It looks alot like VS Code, now - because it's running - and you can choose to run in the cloud - or click the drop down of the green button on the CS50.dev page to run locally with VSCode locally on your machine.  Try it on your 7Hills iPad!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>After all, wouldn&#8217;t you like to get programming right away, without having to download, install, or configure much of anything at all?</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Head to <a href="https://cs50.dev/">CS50.dev</a> and log into through your github account. The first time you run it - it may ask for permissions and allow VSCode, Codespaces and/or Github to run together.  Click through the various promts in the affirmative to run - if you aren't sure - slow down and read, then ask me questions in class next time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>You should then be informed that CS50 (workspaces or cs50.dev) is "creating your workspace" and "creating your container," which might take a moment. You should eventually see your workspace, which should resemble mine from week 1 - if not - see me ASAP.</p>

    <p>You may see prompts from time to time in the lower right to update or restart spaces.  Do not ignore these - take a moment to make sure your workspace has started and is fully updated and upgraded to save you delays and frustration later.</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Notice there are thee main areas of the codespaces IDE - On the left a file explorer window (you may need to toggle on and off the icon to display the folders.  Other icons will allow other tools we'll discuss later.  In the top section of the window, a little off to the right - is the EDITOR pane - this is where you'll type and edit your code.  In the lower section of the screen - you should see a $ or prompt - to indicate that the CLI - Command Line Interface is running.  Again - more later.  From the terminal - you can create directories or folders, compile or MAKE the program you just types, and run or './' the program to see it execute.</p>
    </div>
	<h3>Your First Example Code</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Let&#8217;s get started.  First - in the terminal window at the bottom of the screen - we'll click to the right of the $ sign and type: <br /> <code>mkdir week1</code>. "mkdir" is a command to create a new folder or directory.  You should see a new folder appear in the left file window with the name "week1"  - <br /> - Now - it's easy to point or mouse and click on that folder, but in order to work in that folder with the terminal or command prompt, we need to change <i>into</i> that directory by typing <code>cd week1</code>.  </p>
	<p>You should notice the $ prompt has changed. It should now look like <code>week1/ $</code>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Now - let's create a file in the new folder, week1 so we can write code in the file. Type <code>code hello.c</code> next to the prompt.  Hit Enter.  Now - you should see a new tab appear at the top 'edit' window and - if you move your mose and click on the 'week1' folder in the top left a new file, 'hello.c' should appear.  In the command prompt or terminal, type <code>ls</code>.  Notice that the terminal should look similar to the picture below (I'm using a dark mode theme) <br/>
	<img src="hello.png"></p>
	<p>Okay, on the top pane or window, you should see the tab labelled <code>hello.c</code> Let's write some code!</p>
    </div>
    
<div class="sect1">
    <h2 id="specification"><a class="link" href="#specification">Specification</a></h2>
    <div class="sectionbody">
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>So - let's write your first program? Inside of your <strong>week1</strong> folder, we created a new file called <strong>hello.c</strong>, and then opened that file in a tab. (Remember how?) Be sure to name the file just as we have, in all lowercase; files' and folders' names in Linux are "case-sensitive." Proceed to write your first program by typing precisely these lines into the file:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
    <div class="content">
    <pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="c"><span></span><span class="tok-cp">#include</span> <span class="tok-cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="tok-cp"></span>
    
    <span class="tok-kt">int</span> <span class="tok-nf">main</span><span class="tok-p">(</span><span class="tok-kt">void</span><span class="tok-p">)</span>
    <span class="tok-p">{</span>
        <span class="tok-n">printf</span><span class="tok-p">(</span><span class="tok-s">&quot;hello, world</span><span class="tok-se">\n</span><span class="tok-s">&quot;</span><span class="tok-p">);</span>
    <span class="tok-p">}</span></code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Notice how the IDE adds "syntax highlighting" (i.e., color) as you type, though the different theme colors might differ from this problem set&#8217;s. Those colors aren&#8217;t actually saved inside of the file itself; they&#8217;re just added by CS50 IDE to make certain syntax stand out. Had you not saved the file as <code>hello.c</code> from the start, CS50 IDE wouldn&#8217;t know (per the filename&#8217;s extension) that you&#8217;re writing C code, in which case those colors would be absent.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Do be sure that you type this program just right, else you&#8217;re about to experience your first bug! In particular, capitalization matters, so don&#8217;t accidentally capitalize words (unless they&#8217;re between those two quotes). And don&#8217;t overlook that one semicolon. C is quite nitpicky!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>When done typing, the file should auto save - but you can choose <ctrl> + s, or <Command> + s on a MAC, but don&#8217;t quit. Recall that the white dot atop the tab should then disappear. Click anywhere in the terminal window beneath your code, and be sure that you&#8217;re inside of <code>~/week1</code>. (Remember how? If not, type <code>cd</code> and then Enter, followed by <code>cd week1</code> and then Enter.) Your prompt should be:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
    <div class="content">
    <pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="text"><span></span>week1/ $</code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Let&#8217;s confirm that <code>hello.c</code> is indeed where it should be. Type</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
    <div class="content">
    <pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="text"><span></span>ls</code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>followed by Enter, and you should see <code>hello.c</code>? If not, no worries; you probably just missed a small step. Best to restart these past several steps or ask for help!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Assuming you indeed see <code>hello.c</code>, let&#8217;s try to compile! Cross your fingers and then type</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
    <div class="content">
    <pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="text"><span></span>make hello</code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>at the prompt, followed by Enter. (Well, maybe don&#8217;t cross your fingers whilst typing.) To be clear, type only <code>hello</code> here, not <code>hello.c</code>. If all that you see is another, identical prompt, that means it worked! Your source code has been translated to object code (0s and 1s) that you can now execute. Type</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
    <div class="content">
    <pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="text"><span></span>./hello</code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>at your prompt, followed by Enter, and you should see the below:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
    <div class="content">
    <pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="text"><span></span>hello, world</code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>And if you type</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
    <div class="content">
    <pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="text"><span></span>ls</code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>followed by Enter, you should see a new file, <code>hello</code>, alongside <code>hello.c</code>. The first of those files, <code>hello</code>, should have an asterisk after its name that, in this context, means it&#8217;s "executable," a program that you can execute (i.e., run).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>If, though, upon running <code>make</code>, you instead see some error(s), it&#8217;s time to debug! (If the terminal window&#8217;s too small to see everything, click and drag its top border upward to increase its height.) If you see an error like "expected declaration" or something just as mysterious, odds are you made a syntax error (i.e., typo) by omitting some character or adding something in the wrong place. Scour your code for any differences using the code sample above. It&#8217;s easy to miss the slightest of things when learning to program, so do compare your code against ours character by character; odds are the mistake(s) will jump out! Anytime you make changes to your own code, just remember you need to recompile or type </p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
    <div class="content">
    <pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="text"><span></span>make hello</code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>at your prompt, followed by Enter. (Just be sure that you are inside of <code>week1/ $</code> within your terminal window, as your prompt will confirm or deny.) If still seeing errors, ask a neighbor to guide not give, talk to your duck or ask me (In that order).</p>
    </div>
    <p>Once you see no more errors, try "executing" (i.e., running) your program by typing</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
    <div class="content">
    <pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="text"><span></span>./hello</code></pre>

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>at your prompt, followed by Enter! Hopefully you now see whatever you told <code>printf</code> to print?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>If not, reach out for help!  Incidentally, if you find the terminal window too small for your tastes, try zooming in (control and the plus sign or command and plus sign ).</p>
