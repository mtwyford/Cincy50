        <p>This course&#8217;s philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable." The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course&#8217;s material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on problems is not permitted (unless explicitly stated otherwise) except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code or writing to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy&#8217;s other constraints. Collaboration on quizzes and tests is not permitted at all. Collaboration on the final project is permitted to the extent prescribed by its specification.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Below are rules of thumb that (inexhaustively) characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it until you solicit and receive approval in writing from your instructor. If a violation of this policy is suspected and confirmed, your instructor reserves the right to impose local sanctions on top of any disciplinary outcome that may include an unsatisfactory or failing grade for work submitted or for the course itself.</p>

        <p>Recall that CS50 IDE is a web-based "integrated development environment" that allows you to program "in the cloud," without installing any software locally. Underneath the hood is a popular operating system, Ubuntu Linux, that’s been "containerized" with open-source software called Docker, that allows multiple users (like you!) to share the operating system’s "kernel" (its nucleus, so to speak) and files, even while having files of their own. Indeed, CS50 IDE provides you with your very own "workspace" (i.e., storage space) in which you can save your own files and folders (aka directories).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>After all, wouldn&#8217;t you like to get programming right away, without having to download, install, or configure much of anything at all?</p>

        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>You should then be informed that CS50 IDE (aka Cloud9, the software that underlies CS50 IDE) is "creating your workspace" and "creating your container," which might take a moment. You should eventually see your workspace, which should resemble David&#8217;s from Week 1. If not, do just email the course&#8217;s heads to inquire!</p>

        <p>Okay, let&#8217;s create a folder (otherwise known as a <strong>directory</strong>) in which your code for this problem will soon live. On the left side of the screen you should see a file tree listing the current contents of your CS50 IDE workspace (right now it should simply be a folder entitled <code>~/</code>). Right-click in the blank space underneath that folder and select <strong>New Folder</strong> near the bottom of the context menu that pops up. This should create, as expected, a new folder for you entitled <strong>New Folder</strong> which you can rename now to <code>chapter1</code>. If you accidentally leave it named <code>New Folder</code>, simply right click on the folder, choose <strong>Rename</strong> from the context menu, and rename it. Inside <code>chapter1</code>, add another new folder named <code>hello</code>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Front and center in the CS50 IDE workspace is a window wherein you&#8217;ll be able to write your code. Right now, assuming you haven&#8217;t played around with the tabs, that window is blank.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Let&#8217;s create a new file to play around with. Right-click on your newly-created <code>hello</code> folder and choose <strong>New File</strong> from the context menu. Then, double-click on this new file (which should hopefully be called <code>Untitled</code> and which should be nested beneath <code>hello</code> in the file tree), and a blank window should open up a tab for <code>Untitled</code> as the active one.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Go ahead and type <code>hello</code> (or the ever-popular <code>asdf</code>) on line 1 of the document, and then notice how the tab&#8217;s name now contains a red dot, indicating that you&#8217;ve made changes since the file was first opened. Select <strong>File &gt; Save</strong>, and that red dot should turn green and then disappear, indicating all of our changes are saved.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
        <p><code>Untitled</code> isn&#8217;t exactly a useful name for this file though, is it? Let&#8217;s fix that! In the file tree on the left, right-click on <code>Untitled</code> and select <strong>Rename</strong> from the context menu. Enter <code>hello.txt</code> when able, and then hit Enter on your keyboard. You should see the name of the file has changed both in the file tree on the left and in the name of the tab.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Okay, with <code>hello.txt</code> still open in your workspace, notice that beneath your document is that terminal window. Notice that the window&#8217;s prompt is, assuming you haven&#8217;t otherwise manipulated it</p>

        <p>(where <code>~/</code>—i.e., your home directory—is the directory you are currently in.) If that&#8217;s the case, based on the file tree should be both a <code>chapter1</code> and a <code>hello</code> directory somewhere inside, since we created them just a few moments ago. Let&#8217;s confirm as much.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Click somewhere inside of that terminal window and type</p>

        <p>followed by Enter. You should see <code>hello.txt</code>! Now, you can&#8217;t click or double-click on that file&#8217;s name there; it&#8217;s just text. But that listing does confirm that <code>hello.txt</code> is where we hoped it would be.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">

        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>and then Enter. It turns out that if you don&#8217;t provide <code>cd</code> with a "command-line argument" (i.e., a directory&#8217;s name), it whisks you back to the <code>~/</code> directory by default.</p>
        </div>

Those colors aren&#8217;t actually saved inside of the file itself; they&#8217;re just added by CS50 IDE to make certain syntax stand out. Had you not saved the file as <code>hello.c</code> from the start, CS50 IDE wouldn&#8217;t know (per the filename&#8217;s extension) that you&#8217;re writing C code, in which case those colors would be absent.</p>

        <p>If, though, upon running <code>make</code>, you instead see some error(s), it&#8217;s time to debug! (If the terminal window&#8217;s too small to see everything, click and drag its top border upward to increase its height.) If you see an error like "expected declaration" or something just as mysterious, odds are you made a syntax error (i.e., typo) by omitting some character or adding something in the wrong place. Scour your code for any differences vis-à-vis the template above. It&#8217;s easy to miss the slightest of things when learning to program, so do compare your code against ours character by character; odds are the mistake(s) will jump out! Anytime you make changes to your own code, just remember to re-save via <strong>File &gt; Save</strong> (or command- or control-s), then re-click inside of the terminal window, and then re-type</p>

        <p>at your prompt, followed by Enter. (Just be sure that you are inside of <code>~/chapter1/hello/</code> within your terminal window, as your prompt will confirm or deny.) If still seeing errors, try "prepending" <code>help50</code> to your command like this:</p>

        <p>That&#8217;ll pass the output of <code>make hello</code> to a program called <code>help50</code>, which CS50&#8217;s staff wrote. If <code>help50</code> recognizes your error message, it&#8217;ll offer some suggestions (in yellow). Just realize <code>help50</code> is new this year, so odds are it won&#8217;t recognize all error messages just yet!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Once you see no more errors, try "executing" (i.e., running) your program by typing</p>

        <p>If not, reach out for help!  Incidentally, if you find the terminal window too small for your tastes, know that you can open one in a bigger tab by clicking the circled plus (+) icon to the right of your <code>hello.c</code> tab.</p>
